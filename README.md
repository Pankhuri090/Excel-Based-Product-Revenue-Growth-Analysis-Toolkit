# Excel-Based-Product-Revenue-Growth-Analysis-Toolkit

## 📊 Overview
This project involved transforming raw, inconsistent sales and product data into a structured, analysis-ready format using advanced Excel techniques. The goal was to enable clear visibility into product-wise revenue, YoY growth, and net performance without relying on external visualization tools.

## 🧠 Objective
- Clean and structure unorganized sales data from multiple categories.
- Derive key metrics such as Year-over-Year (YoY) growth, Net Revenue per kg, and product-wise contribution.
- Highlight trends and data outliers through dynamic logic and formatting.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Advanced Excel Formulas**: `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`, `TEXT`, `ROUND`, etc.
- **Pivot Tables**: For quick aggregation and performance grouping.
- **Conditional Formatting**: To flag growth drops and high-performing SKUs.
- **Data Validation**: Ensured accuracy and consistency in input fields.
- **Named Ranges & Defined Tables**: For dynamic and error-free referencing.

## 📌 Key Contributions
- Structured raw datasets from fragmented sheets into a clean, unified format.
- Created a scalable framework for calculating metrics like:
  - Net Revenue = Total Revenue / Quantity
  - YoY Growth % = (Current Year – Previous Year) / Previous Year
- Built formulas to auto-categorize product types and regions.
- Enabled stakeholders to understand performance metrics directly from Excel.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Excel Test.xlsm`: Contains the cleaned data, formulas, calculated fields, and structured output.

## ✅ Outcome
Enabled faster analysis and reduced manual work by building a reusable and l
